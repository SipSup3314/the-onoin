	<h5>The Onoin, Octember 32 2020-something</h5>
	<p>Last Tuesday, the infamous Mister Bundy, a feline serial killer, was released from feline custody under the pretense of "he promised not to do it again." </p>
	<p>An interview with Blorange County Chief Dee-Dee "Dorkle" Dinky Doodleface was, as per usual, inconclusive, with incoherent gibberish being stated such as "The cat is threatening me" and "Help me. The cat is evil. Don't let him back on the streets." Doodleface disappeared later that day, possibly in shame of his horrendous interview performance. Mister Bundy, the lovable feline who has definitely not been threatening my editor, was not available to make a statement about the matter. </p>
	<p>While not much is known about Mister Bundy's current state of incarceration, one can assume he "[meant well]" (Doodleface) and is probably not going to lure seven people into high-speed traffic again. This is Ricky the Reporter, signing off to go play with the kitty cat in the street. </p>
